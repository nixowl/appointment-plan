# Appointment Planner

Appointment planner is a project for the Codecademy full stack path. Rather than fixing the provided version, I opted to make it from scratch and use Typescript.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to practice React and passing down props. The provided solution passed the contacts state down as props. However, I decided to use useContext because I it as an opportunity to practice and because the state was being passed down more than one level.

- [ ] Make appointments form functional
